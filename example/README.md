# SuperSonic - Demonstration

A working example of SuperSonic in the browser.

Send and receive OSC, view debug output, built-in scope and load Sonic Pi synthdefs to experiment with.

## Running

You need Ruby installed. This runs a simple HTTP server with the required COOP/COEP headers.

Start the server:
```bash
ruby server.rb
```

Then open the URL printed to the terminal.

If you prefer a different web server, ensure it sets the required headers and serves this example directory.
