# SuperSonic - Demonstration

A working example of SuperSonic in the browser.

Send and receive OSC, view debug, built-in scope and support for loading some of the Sonic Pi synthdefs to play with.

## Installation

For this example you need Ruby on your system - this is just so we can fire up a simple http server with the correct COOP/COEP headers set. If you're familiar with web server, you can easily fire up your own - ensure the headers are set and serve this example directory and everything should just work immedisatey.

## Running

Simple start the server with `ruby server.rb` and then go to the URL printed to the terminal.

## Enjoy

Have fun!
